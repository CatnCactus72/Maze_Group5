The cheese cake of Tom's owner (we actually don't know her name) has always been stolen.
So she ordered Tom to find the culprit (Jerry, of course).
Jerry's house is a maze. There are 3 levels of the maze (Easy, Medium, Hard). 
The higher level you choose, the larger and more complex is the maze.
Help Tom enter the maze and catch Jerry for his owner. 
Use arrow keys to move, or you can change the keys in Settings.

Game modes:
1. Normal: Catch Jerry and you win.
2. Speedrun: Tom's owner is so angry now, so he has to be quick. Try to find Jerry as fast as possible!
3. Collect: Help Tom collect cheese as much as possible.
